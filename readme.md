# Comprehensive Calculator Program

This is a comprehensive calculator program that includes various types of calculators for chemistry, bio laboratory, finance, physics, programming, and real-time currency exchange rates using an external API. The program is implemented in C++ and uses the `libcurl` library to fetch currency exchange rates.

## Features

- **Chemistry Calculators:**
  - Molecular Weight
  - Stoichiometry
  - Molarity
  - Reaction Rate
  
- **Thermodynamics Calculator:**
  - Gibbs Free Energy
  
- **Electrochemistry Calculator:**
  - Nernst Equation
  
- **Bio Laboratory Calculator:**
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  
- **Finance Calculator:**
  - Compound Interest
  
- **Programming Calculators:**
  - Decimal to Binary
  - ASCII to Char
  - Char to ASCII
  
- **Physics Calculator:**
  - Kinetic Energy
  
- **Currency Exchange Rates:**
  - Fetch real-time currency exchange rates using the `exchangerate-api.com` API.

## Requirements

### Windows:
- C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW, MSVC)
- `libcurl` library

### Linux:
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- `libcurl` library

## Setup Instructions

### Windows

1. **Install MinGW:**
   - Download and install MinGW from [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
   - Ensure that the `g++` compiler is included during installation.

2. **Install `libcurl`:**
   - Download the Windows binaries for `libcurl` from [curl official website](https://curl.se/windows/).
   - Extract the files and place the headers and binaries in a known location.

3. **Add `libcurl` to MinGW:**
   - Copy the `libcurl` headers (`curl.h`, etc.) to the MinGW include directory.
   - Copy the compiled library files (e.g., `libcurl.a`) to the MinGW `lib` directory.

4. **Compile and Run:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp -lcurl
   ```

   This will compile the code and link it with the `libcurl` library. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./calculator.exe
   ```

### Linux

1. **Install the required dependencies:**

   On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install g++ libcurl4-openssl-dev
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `calculator.cpp` file is located. Run the following command to compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ -o calculator calculator.cpp -lcurl
   ```

   Once compiled, you can run the program with:

   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```

## Usage

When you run the program, a menu will appear where you can select different calculator types. For example:

```

15. Exit
Select an option (1-15):
```

You can choose an option by typing the corresponding number and pressing Enter.

## API Integration

The program fetches real-time currency exchange rates using `libcurl` from the `exchangerate-api.com` API. The API request is performed using the `getCurrencyExchange()` function. Make sure you have an active internet connection when using this feature.
